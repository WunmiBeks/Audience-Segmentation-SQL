Velloria Events, is hosting an exclusive gala dinner and wants to set up a one-time promotional campaign in SFMC. This campaign will invite eligible subscribers from their database to attend the event. The task is to design an automation and journey to target the right audience and ensure the promotional email includes data for dynamic content based on subscriber preferences. 

The campaign’s target audience criteria are as follows: 
•	Include only subscribers who have opted into email communications.
•	Exclude subscribers who have already attended any other “gala” event in the last 12 months (recorded in an Event Attendance DE).
•	Include only subscribers who are classified as Platinum and Gold-tier customers (stored in the Customer Tier DE)
•	The email developer has created a separate email for the Platinum and Gold Tiered members however requested the following fields for the final DE to use for dynamic content:
o	The NearestLocation (nearest event location) based on the subscriber’s city.
o	EventName (event name of the promoted gala dinner event).
